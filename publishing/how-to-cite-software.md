## How do I cite software in my papers?

This is a brief introdution to citing software in your papers and why that is important. 

[tl;dr] Do cite software as you would science references. Put citations in the text, in a dedicated \software seciton or in the acknowledgements. Anywhere. If you are unsure how to cite it, ask for help.

### Why should I cite software? 

All research carried out today uses software (Momcheva & Tollerud, 2015). These uses include reducing and analysing data, creating visualizations and plots, simulating physical processes, among many others. As such, software is a integral part of doing science. There are (at least) three main reasons why you should cite software in your papers:

1. Writing software, much like building instruments, requires significant effort. Citing software gives credit to its authors, especially those in academia, and allows them to keep track of the impact of their work in the same way we measure impact by the number of citations of science papers. For  projects which have used grant funding to produce software, citations can be reported to funding agencies and used to justify continued funding.
2. Citations help with research reprodicibility and allows others to understand how a given task was carried out. 
3. Citations to software allow other researchers to discover it. They can then use it for other purposes, advancing their own research field.

### What software should I cite?

According to the FORCE11 recommendations (Smith et al., 2016): _"software should be cited on the same basis as any other research product such as a paper or book; that is, authors should cite the appropriate set of software products just as they cite the appropriate set of papers."_ If a claim relies on the analysis done with a particular software, then you should cite it. 

### Where in my paper should I place the software citations? 

**Example 1:** Include citations to software in the body of the paper, in the same way as you would a cite a relevant paper. For example:

```The my_code library (Doe et al., 2021) was used to derive stellar masses and redshifts for the sources.```

For more examples, see the [AstroBetter post of citing astronomical software](https://www.astrobetter.com/blog/2019/07/01/citing-astronomy-software-inline-text-examples/).

**Example 2:** The AAS Journals (ApJ, ApJL, ApJS and AJ) allow for a separate section dedicated to software. This section appears before the acknowledgements and is marked by a ```\software``` tag. The tag is included in the AAS journals template. This is a good place to include citations to libraries and open source software projects that were key dependancies but did not get shout-outs in the text of the paper. Here is an example of what this section looks like from [Finkelstein et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.12474.pdf):

```
_Software_: Astropy (Astropy Collaboration et al.
2013), Bagpipes (Carnall et al. 2018), Cigale (Burgarella et al. 2005; Noll et al. 2009; Boquien et al.
2019), Dense Basis (Iyer & Gawiser 2017; Iyer et al.
2019), Drizzle (Fruchter & Hook 2002), eazy (Brammer et al. 2008), GalfitM (Peng et al. 2010; Hau√üler
et al. 2013), Photutils (Bradley et al. 2020), Prospector (Johnson et al. 2021), SciPy (Virtanen et al. 2020),
Source Extractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996), Statmorph (Rodriguez-Gomez et al. 2019), STScI JWST
Calibration Pipeline (jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io)
```
The [(Astronomy) Acknowledgement Generator](https://github.com/astrofrog/acknowledgment-generator) can get yous started on creating the ```\software``` section. 

**Example 3:** For journals that do not have a ```\software``` section, the current recommendation is to include software in the acknowledgements. For example see the MNRAS submission of [Baffuret et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.14733.pdf) (2022): 

```
Facilities: JWST, HST
Software: matplotlib (Hunter 2007), numpy (Oliphant 2015),
scipy (Virtanen et al. 2020), jupyter (Kluyver et al. 2016),
Astropy (Astropy Collaboration et al. 2013, 2018), grizli (Brammer 2018), 
SExtractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996), bagpipes (Carnall et al. 2018).
```

### How should I format my software citations?

The best way to cite software is to include a reference to it in the bibliography. Only entries included in the bibliography are tracked by services that count citations! Footnotes and URLs included in the text of the paper without a reference in the bibliography do not give proper credit to the authors. 

When trying to find how to cite software we suggest you follow these steps:

#### Best: Use information provided by the authors

1. If the authors of the software have a recommended way of getting cited, please use that. Examples: [`astropy`](https://www.astropy.org/acknowledging.html), [`exoplanet`](https://docs.exoplanet.codes/en/latest/tutorials/citation/) and [LMFIT](https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/faq.html#how-should-i-cite-lmfit). If there is a paper that is associated with the software, do include the reference to that paper in your bibliography just as you would with any other reference. 

2. If the software is on GitHub and it has a `CITATION.cff` file, use the handy option provided by GitHub to download a BIBTeX citation and include that in your bibliography. See for example the [`eazy-py`](https://github.com/gbrammer/eazy-py) repository.

3. If the software has a digital object identifier (DOI) mentioned anywhere on its repository or documentation page, you can usually follow the link or [resolve the DOI](https://dx.doi.org/). Most hosting platforms provide a way to download a BIBTeX reference. Examples: 
    - The LMFIT GitHub [reposotory](https://github.com/lmfit/lmfit-py/tree/1.0.3) includes the Zenodo DOI [link](https://zenodo.org/record/11813#.YqKAgxNBxBw) which has the [BiBTeX reference](https://zenodo.org/record/5570790/export/hx#.YqKArBNBxBw).
    - The Virgo [repository](https://github.com/0xCoto/Virgo) has a JOSS DOI [link](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.03067) with an easy-to-copy citation in the left-hand bar (as well as a [CITATION.bib file](https://github.com/0xCoto/Virgo/blob/master/CITATION.bib))

4. If none of these are available, but there is a paper that descibes the algorithm and is the standard reference, cite that. Example: [LA Cosmic](http://www.astro.yale.edu/dokkum/lacosmic/) is described in [van Dokkum (2001)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001PASP..113.1420V/abstract)

If more than one of these options exist, i.e., there is a `CITATION.cff` file AND a paper describing the software, do cite both. Including a reference is cheap, giving proper credit to your colleagues is priceless.

#### Good: Search for other breadcrumbs

There are cases where the authors do not provide explicit directions on how their software should be cited. These codes should still be credited in cases they have contributed significantly to the results in your paper. Look for some external posibilities on a best effort basis:

1. Search [ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/) for papers by the software authors that describe the code. ADS now indexes papers by the [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/).

2. Search the [Astrophysics Source Coude Library](https://ascl.net/) (ASCL). ASCL generates an unique identifier in ADS which can then be cited. For example, the [2dfdr](https://ascl.net/1505.015) code mentioned in [Martin et al. (2005)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005PASA...22..236M/abstract) can be cited as [2015ascl.soft05015A](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ascl.soft05015A/abstract). Use the ASCL entry only if the authors have not provided direct instructions. Many ASCL entries are auto-generated and divergent from the authors' instructions. Example: the [`grizli`](https://github.com/gbrammer/grizli) library has a Zenodo DOI which is not listed on the auto-generated [ASCL page](https://ascl.net/1905.001).

#### Better than nothing: Include a link to the software in a footnote 

If you have exhausted all other avenues, including a link to the software in a footnote is better than not citing it at all. Here are examples form an AstroBetter blog post: https://www.astrobetter.com/blog/2019/07/01/citing-astronomy-software-inline-text-examples/

Hope these recommendations are helpful. If in doubt, get in touch with the Data Science Group.
